# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for the best place to utilize my skills in tech recruitment and data analysis.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about recruitment metrics, startup life, fintech.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sokolalexandra/)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have spent the last 5 years hiring for fintech, so if you want to chat about FCA regulations, which neobanks I love or hate, and what app to use to buy ETFs, I am your girl.

### My portfolio lives [here](https://github.com/kytsychkyna/portfolio).

And here are some interesting stuff that you can poke around:

- Transactional analysis of ecom marketplace Olist
  - RFM analysis of customer population
  - Product analysis of user session duration

Here on GitHub, you can find some of the projects I've worked on during a year of comprehensive Data Analytics studies.

What I have mastered but it is outside of my portfolio scope:
- Cohort and LTV analysis
- A/B testing
- Marketing analytics
- Hardcore Looker.io viz and storytelling with data projects :)
